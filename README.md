## Introduction[![](./README_docsAndimages/pin.svg)](#introduction)

We believe job search should be light, not stressful and complicated. We created this data-oriented and functional-based web app to help individuals clarify their career paths in the Tech industry and bring awareness to the available tech jobs. We do not want to create an environment of jealousy and competition among job seekers but rather a supportive platform where industry leaders, small start-ups or big tech veterans can share their knowledge in their fields to expose the younger generations what they will be expecting if they are embarking on a similar journey.
